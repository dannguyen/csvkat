# TODOS


## csvflatten

- any need to remove unnecessary arguments from base CSVKitUtility?
- csvflatten should have inference
- how does typecasted values work?
- make sure 2.x and 3.x compatible

- [X] write tests
- [x] why do I have to set quote mode to 1 when working with examples/longvals.csv?
- [na] add flag to do max-length record breaking, but in newline mode (e.g. ideal for spreadsheets)
    - Don't need this because in spreadsheets, users can format column width vidsually


## csvsqueeze

- implement by-column cleaning
- implement by character cleaning
    - pass args to lstrip, rstrip
